BST 260 Final Project Repository - Parking Ticket


This site is designed to store and present the project undetaken as a final project for BST260 at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health. The report below will dive into detail regarding the content of the project, but simply but, the goal of the project was to explore the idea that there are more parking tickets given out at different times of the month. This is a commonly discussed idea, with multiple places online citing the veracity or ludicrousness of this claim. The project makes use of the open source parking ticket data from opendataphilly.org, which is cited in the report and at the end.
